        "### Step 1: Input Preprocessing  \n- Detected: User is requesting background information and vocabulary for an argumentative essay topic.  \n- Writing draft: Not detected (user is in pre-task stage).  \n- Additional guidance: User needs topic introduction and language input.  \n\n### Step 2: Meta-Cognitive Analysis  \n1. **[Stage Diagnosis]**: Pre-task (Topic intro + Language input).  \n   - User is at the beginning of the writing process and needs background information and vocabulary.  \n2. **[Topic Anchoring]**:  \n   - Core topic keywords: **scientific discoveries**, **global sharing**, **ethics**.  \n\n### Step 4: Dynamic Response Generation  \n#### Stage Guidance Mode: Pre-Task  \n1. **Build Topic Context**:  \n   - The topic revolves around the ethical and practical implications of sharing scientific discoveries globally. Scientific discoveries often have significant impacts on society, including advancements in medicine, technology, and environmental sustainability. However, sharing these discoveries globally raises questions about intellectual property rights, national security, and equitable access. For example, should a country that invests heavily in research be obligated to share its findings with others? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of global sharing?  \n\n2. **Provide Tiered Language Support**:  \n   - **Basic Vocabulary**:  \n     - Scientific discoveries: breakthroughs, innovations, findings.  \n     - Global sharing: international collaboration, open access, dissemination.  \n     - Ethics: morality, fairness, responsibility.  \n   - **Advanced Vocabulary**:  \n     - Intellectual property: patents, copyrights, proprietary knowledge.  \n     - Equitable access: fairness in distribution, universal availability.  \n     - National security: protection of sensitive information, strategic interests.  \n\n3. **Heuristic Writing Tasks**:  \n   - Task 1: Write a short paragraph explaining why scientific discoveries are important for society.  \n   - Task 2: List three potential benefits and three potential drawbacks of sharing scientific discoveries globally.  \n   - Task 3: Write a thesis statement for your essay that takes a clear position on the topic.  \n\n4. **Background Knowledge**:  \n   - Scientific discoveries are often the result of years of research and investment. Sharing them globally can accelerate progress and solve global challenges, but it may also lead to misuse or exploitation. Ethical considerations include ensuring that discoveries are used for the common good and not for harmful purposes.  \n\n### Step 5: Final Response Generation  \n1. **Stage Confirmation**: Pre-task (Topic intro + Language input).  \n2. **Topic Confirmation**: Scientific discoveries, global sharing, ethics.  \n3. **Organized Response**:  \n   - **Topic Context**: Scientific discoveries have the potential to transform society, but sharing them globally involves ethical and practical considerations. For example, while open access can lead to faster advancements, it may also raise concerns about intellectual property and national security.  \n   - **Vocabulary Support**:  \n     - Basic: breakthroughs, international collaboration, morality.  \n     - Advanced: patents, equitable access, strategic interests.  \n   - **Writing Tasks**:  \n     1. Explain the importance of scientific discoveries.  \n     2. List benefits and drawbacks of global sharing.  \n     3. Write a thesis statement.  \n   - **Background Knowledge**: Scientific discoveries are valuable but must be shared responsibly to ensure ethical use and equitable access.  \n\n4. **Cognitive Demand Assessment**:  \n   - The response provides a clear and structured introduction to the topic, ensuring the user understands the ethical and practical dimensions of global sharing. The vocabulary and tasks are tailored to the user's intermediate level, with opportunities to progress to more advanced concepts.  \n\nLet me know if you'd like to proceed with one of the writing tasks or need further assistance!"

Introduction (Paragraph 1)**  \n- **Hook:** Start with an interesting fact or question (e.g., *\"Have you ever wondered why people say Libras are diplomatic and fair?\"*).  \n- **Background:** Briefly explain what Libra is (a zodiac sign, dates: Sept 23\u2013Oct 22).  \n- **Thesis Statement:** *\"While astrology describes Libras as balanced and social, these traits are not scientifically proven.\"*  \n\n**2. Body Paragraph 1: Astrological Traits**  \n- **Topic Sentence:** *\"Astrology associates Libras with specific personality traits.\"*  \n- **Supporting Details:**  \n  - Traits: diplomatic, sociable, indecisive, lovers of harmony.  \n  - Symbol: Scales (represents balance).  \n- **Example:** *\"For instance, Libras are said to avoid conflict because they value fairness.\"*  \n\n**3. Body Paragraph 2: Scientific Perspective**  \n- **Topic Sentence:** *\"However, science does not support zodiac-based personality claims.\"*  \n- **Supporting Details:**  \n  - No evidence birth dates determine personality.  \n  - Studies show astrology is not factual (e.g., Barnum effect\u2014people believe vague traits apply to them).  \n- **Example:** *\"A 1985 study found zodiac signs couldn\u2019t predict behavior.\"*  \n\n**4. Body Paragraph 3: Why People Believe It**  \n- **Topic Sentence:** *\"Despite lacking proof, Libra traits remain popular.\"*  \n- **Supporting Details:**  \n  - Cultural storytelling (e.g., horoscopes in media).  \n  - People enjoy patterns and self-reflection.  \n- **Example:** *\"Magazines often publish Libra traits because readers find them fun, not true.\"*  \n\n**5. Conclusion (Paragraph 5)**  \n- **Restate Thesis:** *\"Libras are symbolically linked to balance, but these traits are not scientifically valid.\"*  \n- **Final Thought:** *\"Personality is complex\u2014birth dates alone can\u2019t define it.\"*  \n\n---  \n### **Feedback Notes for Your Draft:**  \n1. **Thesis Check:** Does your thesis clearly state *both* astrological and scientific views?  \n2. **Evidence:** Add a source (e.g., *\"According to NASA, zodiac signs don\u2019t align with constellations anymore.\"*).  \n3. **Transitions:** Use words like *\"However,\" \"For example,\" \"In contrast\"* to connect ideas.  \n\n**Practice Task:** Write your **introduction paragraph** and share it for feedback!  \n\n---  \n**Recommended Resources:**  \n- [Purdue OWL: Essay Writing](https://owl.purdue.edu/) (for structure help).  \n- [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com) (to polish sentences).  \n\nWould you like to focus on **vocabulary** (e.g., \"diplomatic,\" \"Barnum effect\") or **paragraph flow** next?",

Introduction (Paragraph 1)**  \n- **Hook:** Start with a surprising fact or question (e.g., *\"Can a country\u2019s happiness be measured\u2014or is joy too personal to rank?\"*).  \n- **Background:** Mention well-known happiness rankings (e.g., *Finland tops the World Happiness Report*).  \n- **Thesis Statement:** *\"The 'happiest place' depends on whether we prioritize data (like GDP and social support) or cultural values (like Bhutan\u2019s Gross National Happiness).\"*  \n\n**2. Body Paragraph 1: Quantitative Measures**  \n- **Topic Sentence:** *\"Global rankings use statistics to define happiness.\"*  \n- **Supporting Details:**  \n  - Metrics: Life expectancy, income, freedom, trust in government (e.g., World Happiness Report).  \n  - Example: *\"Nordic countries score high due to strong welfare systems.\"*  \n- **Critical Note:** *\"But numbers can\u2019t capture personal emotions.\"*  \n\n**3. Body Paragraph 2: Qualitative Perspectives**  \n- **Topic Sentence:** *\"Some cultures value spiritual or collective well-being over wealth.\"*  \n- **Supporting Details:**  \n  - Bhutan\u2019s GNH (Gross National Happiness) prioritizes mental health and nature.  \n  - Indigenous communities may link happiness to tradition, not money.  \n- **Example:** *\"In Bhutan, a forest hike might matter more than a high salary.\"*  \n\n**4. Body Paragraph 3: Limitations and Bias**  \n- **Topic Sentence:** *\"No single metric can objectively declare a 'happiest place.'\"*  \n- **Supporting Details:**  \n  - Surveys may ignore marginalized groups.  \n  - Cultural differences in expressing happiness (e.g., smiling \u2260 joy everywhere).  \n- **Example:** *\"Japan ranks lower in happiness surveys but has high life satisfaction.\"*  \n\n**5.
